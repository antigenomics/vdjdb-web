[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/vdjdb-web/badge/?version=latest)](http://vdjdb-web.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

VDJdb-server uses [VDJtools API](https://github.com/mikessh/vdjtools) and [VDJdb API](https://github.com/antigenomics/vdjdb-standalone) as a back-end 
as well as [Angular](https://angular.io/) framework as a front-end. 
The software utilizes [Play framework](https://www.playframework.com/) for running the server instance. 
**This software is intended for advanced users** -- we recommend using either the [VDJdb web portal](https://vdjdb.cdr3.net) 
or the standalone VDJdb application with command line interface that can be found [here](https://github.com/antigenomics/vdjdb-standalone).

List of features and detailed documentation can be found at [ReadTheDocs](http://vdjdb-web.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
