VDJdb-server uses [VDJtools API](https://github.com/mikessh/vdjtools) and [VDJdb API](https://github.com/antigenomics/vdjdb-standalone) as a back-end. 
The software utilizes [Play framework](https://www.playframework.com/) for running the server instance. 
**This software is intended for advanced users** -- we recommend using either the [VDJdb web portal](https://vdjdb.cdr3.net) 
or the standalone VDJdb application with command line interface that can be found [here](https://github.com/antigenomics/vdjdb-standalone).
