        <p>Here you can upload your T-cell receptor repertoire sequencing data and annotate it by performing batch queries of the VDJdb database.</p>
        <p>To proceed with the analysis, go to the upload section, add your samples, and click on the sample name in the panel on the left.
            After running the annotation, you can view the table of VDJdb matches (click <b>Table</b> below the sample name) and
            annotation summary charts (click <b>Charts</b> below the sample name).</p>
        <p>If you want to annotate all your samples together and get a summary statistics report for your dataset,
            click <b>All samples</b> in the panel on the left.</p>
