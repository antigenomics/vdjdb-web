<filters-header headerTitle="Haplotype" headerHelp="<p>Specify first and second MHC allele filters.</p>
    <p>Click on the text field to see the list of known MHC allele IDs, start typing to narrow the list. It is possible to select multiple IDs.</p>
    <p>Incomplete queries will be treated as substrings. For example 'HLA-A*02' will match 'HLA-A*02, HLA-A*02, HLA-A*02:01 etc'.</p>
    <p>The second MHC allele is only meaningful for MHC class II and is set to B2M (beta 2 microglobulin) for MHC class I records.</p>">
